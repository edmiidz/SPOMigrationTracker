# SPOMigrationTracker - SharePoint Online Migration Status Browser Extension


This browser extension, coupled with middleware, queries the migration status database during SharePoint Online migrations. It displays a status icon indicating the current state of the migration. Clicking on this icon reveals additional statistics about the migration, such as the original location of the site, its new location, and the approximate completion time.

Additionally, the pop-up window includes a 'Submit Issue' button. Clicking this button captures the site URL, opens a form with the URL already filled in, and allows users to describe any issues they encounter with the site.
